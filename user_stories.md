Our marketing research team is trying to up their sales.

So with that we will have -
Marketing
Developers
Users

Marketing team wants to find out what products will sell the most. They've already provided the items for us to use. They want the product to be randomized, there should be no duplicates showed at one time in the display. Nor be a an image that we displayed immediately before.
Also they want to showcase the data at the end to the client after 25 selections have been made.
They are also not only interested in the amount of clicks the item gets but they want the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it is shown.

Developers: What the developer will be doing is just that.
Building an app that will showcase three items only at a time.
Once the user clicks an image, three new non-duplicating random images will populate.
But making sure when the new images populate they will not be any duplicates in the same row nor will be the same image that was displayed before.

Will have to create a constructor function that creates an object associated with each image.
After 25 selections have been made, turn off the event listeners on the images.
Display a list of products with votes received with each list item looking like "3 voted for the banana slicer".
